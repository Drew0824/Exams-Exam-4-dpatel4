# Rectangle Area

Your job is to write a program will ask the user to enter the width and length of a rectangle and then display the rectangle’s area. 

The main function in the program should call the following functions, which you need to define in the code:
- getLength – This function should ask the user to enter the rectangle’s length and then return that value as a double.
- getWidth – This function should ask the user to enter the rectangle’s width and then return that value as a double.
- getArea – This function should accept the rectangle’s length and width as arguments and return the rectangle’s area. The area is calculated by multiplying the length by the width.
- displayData – This function should accept the rectangle’s length, width, and area as arguments and display them in an appropriate message on the screen.

_Sample run:_
```
Enter the length: 4
Enter the width: 5
-----Rectangle Data---------
Length: 4
Width: 5
Area: 20
```
